# Notation
Here are a few points on the notation used in the remainder of the document.

Vectors will be represented for the most part by lowercase bold-faced latin letters, e.g. ``a``, ``b``, ... except for out of departure from convention such as ``\mathbf{E}`` for the electric field vector.

Second order tensors will be represented for the most part by uppercase bold-faced latin letters, e.g. ``\mathbf{A}``, ``\mathbf{B}``, ... except for out of departure form convention such as ``\mathbf{\sigma}`` for the Cauchy stress.
